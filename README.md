## Getting started

> To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- `Git`
- `Ruby 2.6.5`
- `Rails 6`
- `PostgreSQL`

### Setup

To clone the project in your local environment do the following

- Open a new `terminal` window and navigate to the directory where the project will be stored
- Run the command `git clone git@github.com:oscardelalanza/satic_pages.git`
- Run the command `cd satic_pages` to enter the project directory

### Install

- Install the required gems running the command `bundle install --without production`
- Install the required node modules running the command `yarn install`
- Create and migrate the database running the command `rails db:migrate`

### Usage

### Run tests

- Run the command `rails test`

### Deployment

- To start the local server run the command `rails server`

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

$ rails server
```
